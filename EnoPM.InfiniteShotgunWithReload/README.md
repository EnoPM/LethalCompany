# InfiniteShotgunWithReload
### InfiniteShotgunWithReload is a Lethal Company mod that allows you to reload the shotgun without having any shells.
#### In order to ensure fair play and avoid any abuse this mod is no longer client-side. To be enabled the game host must also own the mod and not have disabled it in their configuration file.
